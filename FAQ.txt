General Questions
=================

What is PyFITS?
---------------

PyFITS_ is a library written in, and for use with the Python_ programming
language for reading, writing, and manipulating FITS_ formatted files.  It
includes a high-level interface to FITS headers with the ability for high and
low-level manipulation of headers, and it supports reading image and table
data as Numpy_ arrays.  It also supports more obscure and non-standard formats
found in some FITS files.

PyFITS includes two command-line utilities for working with FITS files:
fitscheck, which can verify and write FITS checksums; and fitsdiff, which can
analyze and display the differences between two FITS files.

Although PyFITS is written mostly in Python, it includes an optional module
written in C that's required to read/write compressed image data.  However,
the rest of PyFITS functions without this extension module.

What is the development status of PyFITS?
-----------------------------------------

PyFITS is written and maintained by the Science Software Branch at the `Space
Telescope Science Institute`_, and is licensed by AURA_ under a `3-clause BSD
license`_ (see `LICENSE.txt`_ in the PyFITS source code).

PyFITS' current primary developer and active maintainer is `Erik Bray`_, though
patch submissions are welcome from anyone.  It has a `Trac site`_ where the
source code can be browsed, and where bug reports may be submitted.  The source
code resides primarily in an `SVN repository`_ which allows anonymous
checkouts, though a `Git mirror`_ also exists.  PyFITS also has a `GitHub
site`_.

The current stable release series is 3.0.x.  Each 3.0.x release tries to
contain only bug fixes, and to not introduce any significant behavioral or API
changes (though this isn't guaranteed to be perfect).  The upcoming 3.1 release
will contain new features and some API changes, though will try maintain as
much backwards-compatibility as possible.  After the 3.1 release there may be
further 3.0.x releases for bug fixes only where possible.  Older versions of
PyFITS (2.4 and earlier) are no longer actively supported.

PyFITS is also included as a major component of upcoming Astropy_ project as
the `astropy.io.fits` module.  The goal is for Astropy to eventually serve as a
drop-in replacement for PyFITS (it even includes a legacy-compatibility mode
where the `astropy.io.fits` module can still be imported as `pyfits`.
However, for the time being PyFITS will still be released as an independent
product as well, until such time that the Astropy project proves successful and
widely-adopted.

Build and Installation Questions
================================

Is PyFITS available on Windows?
-------------------------------

Yes--the majority of PyFITS is pure Python, and can be installed and used on
any platform that supports Python (>=2.5).  However, PyFITS includes an
optional C extension module for reading/writing compressed image HDUs.  As most
Windows systems are not configured to compile C source code, binary installers
are also available for Windows.  Though PyFITS can also be installed from
source even on Windows systems without a compiler by disabling the compression
module.  See `How do I install PyFITS from source on Windows?`_ for more
details.

Where is the Windows installer for version X of PyFITS on version Y of Python?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every official PyFITS build for Windows is eventually uploaded to PyPI_.  This
includes builds for every major Python release from 2.5.x and up, except for
3.0 as there is no official Numpy release for Python 3.0 on Windows.  The one
binary module included in these builds was linked with Numpy 1.6.1, though it
should work with other recent Numpy versions.

Sometimes the Windows binary installers don't go up immediately after every
PyFITS release.  But if they appear missing they should go up within another
business day or two.  This has gotten better with recent releases thanks to
some automation.
